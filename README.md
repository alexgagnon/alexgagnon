- Hi, Iâ€™m @alexgagnon
- Iâ€™m interested in full-stack web dev with TS (mostly Lit and Astro for frontend, Express for backend, PostgreSQL for DB), Java & Spring, a dash of AI with Python (ðŸ¤— and PyTorch), and Rust.
- My prefered JS tools are wireit and vite, and I like testing vitest, Playwright, Axe, and Lighthouse.
- I use Cloudfare for edge hosting and Azure for other cloud needs.
- GitHub and Azure DevOps are my goto's for SCM and CI/CD.
- When I'm not making software I'm making beer, houses, and travel plans.
