- Hi, I’m @alexgagnon
- I’m interested in full-stack web dev with JS/TS, Java, Rust, HTML, and CSS, and a dash of ML/NLP with Python and mobile apps with Flutter on the side...
- I like testing my JS with with Jest and sites with Playwright, Axe, and Lighthouse
- I primarily use Cloudfare and Netlify for hosting and and Azure or Linode with Terraform for other cloud needs.
- GitHub and Azure DevOps are my goto's for SCM and CI/CD.
- When I'm not making software I'm making beer, houses, and travel plans.
