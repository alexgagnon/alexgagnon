- Hi, I’m @alexgagnon
- I’m interested in full-stack web dev with JS/TS, Java, Rust, HTML, and CSS, and a dash of ML/NLP with Python and mobile apps with Dart on the side...
- I primarily use Netlify for sites and and Azure with Terraform for everything else.
- Github and Azure DevOps are my goto's for SCM and CI/CD.
